### Objective
To create a straighforward app to track workout progressions in speed as well as increased weight and reps.

### Motivation
Due to Covid19, my very active 70+ father is no longer going to the gym. He laments the loss of the weight machines where he was easily able to keep track of his gains in strength and increased weight. I hope this will give him and others the ability to see gains in their workouts.

* AAU I should be able to see exercises, typical workouts, and example charts without logging in.
